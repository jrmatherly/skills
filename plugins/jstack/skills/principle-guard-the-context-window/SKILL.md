# Guard the Context Window

**Why:** Context overflow degrades reasoning quality, creates compression artifacts, and halts progress.

**Pattern:**
- **Size phases and cap scope.** Limit files per phase, set turn budgets, account for mechanism costs.
- **Partition fan-out by owned surface.** Each brief lists what is out of its slice. Something every slice can see (shared chrome, fonts, config) gets exactly one owner. The same finding from two slices is a partition bug, not confirmation.
